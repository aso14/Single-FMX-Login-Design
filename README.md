# Single-FMX-Login-Design
The Single project is a fictitious project set up to create the connection interface. This project can be compiled in Windows, Android. The iOS version has never been tried, you can still try it and get back to me.

If you plan to compile on a platform such as Windows, make sure you set the property "FullScreen" = False. This will allow you to have a better experience.

Windows Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------
FullScreen = false

Android Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------
FullScreen = true
